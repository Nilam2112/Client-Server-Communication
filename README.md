# Client-Server-Communication

Created a multi-threaded Web server which interacts with clients based on message-oriented communication protocol and client can upload, download, Delete and Rename a file from the server. Implemented a four set of predefined RPCs [calculate_pi(), add(i, j), sort(arrayA), matrix_multiply(matrixA, matrixB, matrixC)] on server, that can be called from a client. Here RPCs represent different ways to pass the parameters to the server. Tech: Java, platform:Eclipse
